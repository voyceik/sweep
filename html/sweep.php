                <h2>SWeeP Application Tools for representation of large biological sequences datasets in compact vectors</h2>
                <p>The SWeeP (Spaced Words Projection) package use high-dimensional vectors (HDV) model to biological sequence representation as alternative for sequences comparison through the conversion of amino acids sequences by a spaced-words slide-window to sets of values, which represents each reading and position in the sequence to vectors (data space).</p>
                <p>In this web site is possible access the SWeeP Portal where there are information about the submit tasks contents the fasta file format (<samp>.fasta</samp>, <samp>.fas</samp> or <samp>.faa</samp> file extension).</p>
                <p>The tasks will executed in our dedicated server that will process the query in selected database and when finished will save the results and notify the submitter by email. The results obtained will be stored for up to 30 days in this server.</p>
